	<li>Azure Windows VM for hosting</li>
	<li>Jira for project management</li>

<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>Jira was used for project management. The project was divided into several tasks, such as setting up the Flask app, creating the SQLite database, implementing the frontend, etc.</p>

<h2>Source Code Management</h2>
<p>Github was used for source code management. The code was pushed to Github after each task was completed.</p>
