# QA-Project
I have created a simple webapp that the user can access, read, update the teams in the European League. I used the Flask framework with SQLite. I then uploaded the code onto Github and used Jenkins to automatically build and deploy a container that runs my webapp. I had many complications to get this working and its still not fully complete. I will document the process till now. 
Tools used: Python using Flask with SQLite, HTML, Azure Linux VM, Jira, Github, Docker, Jenkins
